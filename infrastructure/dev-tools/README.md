# Transaction Monitoring & Audit Dev Tools

Tooling to aid developers. This currently consists of a lambda to delete everything in an S3 bucket. This allows us to automatically tear down stacks (an S3 bucket must be empty before you can delete it).

These are not deployed to integration or production.
